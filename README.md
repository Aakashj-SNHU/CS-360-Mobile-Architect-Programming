Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app's main function is to keep track of stock, and it's built with password and user-id protection so that only authorized users may make changes. After logging in, the program allows the user to modify the database by adding, deleting, increasing, or decreasing records. By selecting a radio option in the app's preferences, users may get notifications if stock levels become dangerously low. A grid layout is used to display the stock.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application's four windows are used for authentication, displaying inventory in a gride layout, configuring notifications and settings, and adding new products. The application's displays employ various shades of green and blue to remain consistent with the concept, and each screen flows well into the next without being confusing or deceptive. Since this was my first attempt at creating an app of this kind, I made care to follow the guidelines and adhere to the standards laid forth in the Android Core Application Quality Document.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
When I first began developing this app, I was full of grandiose ideas and attempted to cram in too many features at once. Due to the increased complexity introduced by the additional features, I was forced to abandon the project. From there, I had a fully functional app from which I could build out other features like a notification system and a menu. I understand that in the future I will need to have a fully functional app before I can begin adding features.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To make sure my code was operating well, I ran it through its paces on a variety of simulated devices with varying screen resolutions and sizes inside the Android IDK. Even while a programmer may design an app with a certain device in mind, it's crucial to remember that the end user may be accessing it from any number of devices.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
At first, I had a hard time putting things in order. I got the alert screen working, but I couldn't get it to coordinate with the menu, and I wasn't sure how to link the radio button at first. I learned how to make the transition by following instructions I found online.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Developing the login authentication screen was a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to integrating new languages with databases while continuing to love working with SQL and its variants like mySQL and noSQL.
